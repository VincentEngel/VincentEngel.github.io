Watch a short preview of the App on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlXy7ZQIdQE)

I started the project to create an app for an art teacher to easily compare images in different ways. After publishing the app, I received a lot of positive feedback. I also enjoyed learning about Android, so I decided to continue working on the app.

**Comparison modes**:

- **Side by Side**: Show the images side by side
- **Overlay Tap**: Place the images behind each other and tap on the screen to quickly switch between them
- **Overlay Slide**: Place the images behind each other and adjust the width of the image in the front
- **Transparent**: Place the images behind each other and adjust the transparency of the image in the front
- **MetaData**: (Beta) Show all Meta Data, like Exif Data, side by side
- **Overlay Cut**: Cut the image from one point to another


You can find it in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vincentengelsoftware.vesandroidimagecompare) as well as the [F-Droid Store](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.vincentengelsoftware.vesandroidimagecompare/)

The app is open source and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/VincentEngel/VES-Image-Compare) as well.

This App was the first I ever created and I was able to learn a lot about the android app lifecycle and how android apps work. It was a very nice learning experience and I am still keeping the App up to date.
